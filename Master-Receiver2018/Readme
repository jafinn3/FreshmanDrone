In order to run this program, you will have to manually change the TIMER which is being used by the Radiohead library.
	Steps:
	1. Navigate to the folder where your libaries are stored ( For me it was /home/jeremy/Arduino/libraries/ )
	2. Now, enter the Radiohead-Master library folder
	3. Locate the RH_ASK.cpp folder and find the text that says

		// RH_ASK on Arduino uses Timer 1 to generate interrupts 8 times per bit interval
		// Define RH_ASK_ARDUINO_USE_TIMER2 if you want to use Timer 2 instead of Timer 1 on Arduino
		// You may need this to work around other librraies that insist on using timer 1
		// Should be moved to header file
		//#define RH_ASK_ARDUINO_USE_TIMER2

	4. Uncomment the last line, #define RH_ASK_ARDUINO_USE_TIMER2 and save the file.
